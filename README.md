# Graphics Toolkit

This is a personal project that lets me test out new ideas and learn some OpenGL programming in the process. I hope that little by little, this will become a good, small game engine that might offer some new ways to solve old problems.

This project is currently available only as an Xcode project on OS X, but I always try to consider cross-platform compatibility when writing new features.
